My name is Norin Chamroeun and I'm 18 years old from Cambodia. I love programming, music, and other stuff that I'm interested in.  

I am a Vue/Nuxt and Nodejs lover. I also have some Python, and C# skills, and am familiar with Cloudflare, Vercel, and Coolify (a bit). My fav tools and daily drive apps are Figma, VSCode, and Firefox. I do play some game and also spend almost 500hrs on [left 4 dead game](https://steamcommunity.com/id/norinyt92/games/?tab=all)
