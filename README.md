My name is Norin Chamroeun and I'm 19 years old from Cambodia. I love programming, music, and other things that interest me. Currently studying at the Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP) in year 1.

I am an enthusiastic developer. I have a lot of experience with JavaScript/TypeScript, and some Python and C# skills also familiar with Cloudflare, Vercel, and Coolify (a bit). My favorite tools and daily drive apps are Figma, VSCode, and Firefox. I do play some game and also spend almost 500hrs on [left 4 dead game](https://steamcommunity.com/id/norinyt92/games/?tab=all)
